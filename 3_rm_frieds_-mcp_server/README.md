C:\Users\rupal\work\repos\ai-agents> uv init 3_rm_frieds_-mcp_server
    -> based on the setup done in 2_mcp_leave_management readme.md
uv run mcp install main.py  to add the MCP Server to Claude
Remember to have Claude in developer mode, restarted after killing from Task Manager
Then under tools icon we see the 4 tools we defined in main.py !!
